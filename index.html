          <p class="intro__text">
            According to polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
            but only 36% plan to spend a vacation in their native country. Like,
            what haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole
            universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the
            Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And you
            can also see all these beauties without millions on your account, a
            passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera
            Bashmakova — a brave young mother who took three children in her
            arms, sat them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across
            her native country. We have selected and described some interesting
            places worthy of your vacation.

              Here, in the middle of forests and sand dunes, you can see two
              water horizons — the calm Curonian Lagoon on one side and the
              rippling waves of the Baltic Sea on the other. A unique natural
              area on the edge of the Russian enclave.

              The Kaliningrad Region does not end there. For the traveler and
              researcher, there is the westernmost point of Russia, the Baltic
              Spit, in the same neighborhood, and the German heritage of placers
              of small seaside towns. The atmosphere of these places eliminates
              the hustle and bustle, plunging into the tranquility of nature and
              the smell of the steel, cool sea.

              Perhaps you were not interested in the ultra-deep well penetrating
              the earth's crust, and apathy has been covering you for a long

              Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all,
              because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will
              see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And
              if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with
              the invisible miracle of these places — mountain air.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to go here in
              summer. So you will see all the diversity of the local flora and
              fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the
              ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls
              are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

              Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world. Many also
              know that this is the largest source of fresh water and one of the
              most beautiful places in Russia.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place
              for skioring competitions. This is a kind of sport when a skier
              ties himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as
              much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019, a world record
              was set at the Baikal Mile Festival — 197.011 km/h.

              Siberia ends not in the Urals, but in Karelia: the Siberian larch
              forming the taiga does not grow west of the Water Lake. But here
              it reaches 30 meters — the forests of Karelian national parks have
              never known an axe because of impassable swamps. Some pines are
              already more than half a millennium old. Touch a living being who
              saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it. In the virgin forest,
              you will not find a trail for a hundred kilometers. And on rare
              paths, trees a couple of meters from the ground are marked with
              bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss here.
